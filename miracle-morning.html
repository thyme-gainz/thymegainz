        <strong>&middot;</strong> 
         ‘The biggest adventure you can ever take is to live the life of your dreams.’ - Oprah
      </p>
      <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
To make profound changes in your life, you need either inspiration or desperation. - Anthony Robbins
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
I had not been developing myself into the person I needed to be, to attract, create, and sustain the level of success that I wanted.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Our outer world will always be a reflection of our inner world. Our level of success is always going to parallel our level of personal development. Until we dedicate time each day to developing ourselves into the person we need to be to create the life we want, success is always going to be a struggle to attain.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
‘If you want your life to be different, you have to be willing to do something different first!’
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
‘I’m going to smile more so that I can bring a little more happiness to my life and to those around me.’ Or, ‘I’m going to ask every person I meet what I can do to help them, so that I can add value to more people’s lives.’) It will be your first step towards a bigger life purpose.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
As you grow and evolve, so will your purpose.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Always remember that when you are committed to a life purpose that is bigger than your problems, your problems become relatively insignificant and you will overcome them with ease.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
When you do choose to do the right thing and follow through with your commitments – especially when you don’t feel like it – you are developing the extraordinary discipline (which most people never develop) necessary for creating extraordinary results in your life.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Wait – this is not who I want to become – someone who doesn’t even have enough discipline to get out of bed in the morning. I’m getting up now, because I am committed to [waking up early, hitting my goals, creating the life of my dreams, etc.].
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Accountability is the act of being responsible to someone else for some action or result.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Accountability has brought order to our lives and allowed us to progress, improve and achieve results we wouldn’t have otherwise.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The fact that sitting still and clearing my mind was so difficult for me was precisely the reason why I had to commit to mastering it.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
In order for your affirmations to be effective, it is important that you tap into your emotions while reading them.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
‘Vision boards are for dreaming, action boards are for achieving.‘
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Remember, the moment you accept total responsibility for everything in your life is the moment you claim the power to change anything in your life.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
No matter what your past has been, you can change your future, by changing the present.

    <div class="list">
      <p><strong>&middot;</strong> 
        Give up the need to be perfect for the opportunity to be authentic. Be who you are. Love who you are. Others will too.
        </p>
        <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
          Replace your judgments with empathy, upgrade your complaining to gratitude, and trade in your fear for love.
        </p>
        <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
          Be grateful for all that you have, accept all that you don’t, and actively create all that you want.
        </p>
        <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
          Life isn’t about wishing you were somewhere or someone that you’re not. Life is about enjoying where you are, loving who you are, and consistently improving both.
        </p>
        <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
          They say misery loves company, but so does mediocrity. Don’t let the limiting beliefs of OTHERS limit what’s possible for YOU.
        </p>
        <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
          The moment you accept responsibility for EVERYTHING in your life is the moment you tap into your power to change ANYTHING in your life.
        </p>
        <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
          Never settle. Create the life you deserve to live, and help others to do the same.
        </p>
        <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
          Who you’re becoming is far more important than what you’re doing. And yet, it is what you’re doing that is determining who you’re becoming.
        </p>
        <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
          The average person lets their emotions dictate their actions, while achievers let their commitments dictate their actions.
        </p>
        <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
          Make bold moves toward your dreams each day, refuse to stop, and nothing can stop you.

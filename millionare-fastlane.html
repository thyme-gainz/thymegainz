        <h2 class="S-H2Main"> <strong>SUMMARY:</strong> </h2>
        <p>"The Millionaire Fastlane" by MJ DeMarco challenges traditional beliefs about wealth accumulation. It outlines three paths to financial success:</p>
        <h2 class="S-H2">Sidewalk:</h2>
        <p>Living paycheck to paycheck without accumulating wealth.</p>
        <h2 class="S-H2">Slowlane:</h2>
        <p>Relying on slow and steady methods like saving, investing, and retirement plans, which may take decades to yield substantial wealth.</p>
        <h2 class="S-H2">Fastlane:</h2>
        <p>Embracing entrepreneurship, leveraging systems, and providing value to build wealth rapidly. The Fastlane approach prioritizes financial freedom and creating businesses that generate significant income streams.</p>
        <p>DeMarco emphasizes the importance of taking calculated risks, focusing on scalability, and creating systems that generate passive income. He challenges readers to break free from societal norms and pursue unconventional paths to financial abundance. Overall, the book advocates for a mindset shift towards proactive wealth creation rather than passive wealth accumulation.</p>

    Chapter 3: The Road Trip to Wealth:
    <span class="icon"></span>
  </summary>
  <div class="list">
  <p>
    <strong>&middot;</strong>  The journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step. - Lao Tzu 
    </p>
    <p>
    <strong>&middot;</strong>  Wealth is a road trip, not just a road.
  </p> 
   <p> 
    <strong>&middot;</strong>  <strong>When you focus on just the road, your journey is likely to stall & dreamy destinations never arrive.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>&middot;</strong>  Millionaires are forged by process, not by events.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>&middot;</strong>  Without process, withered is no event. 
  </p>
<p>
  <strong>&middot;</strong>  The process is the struggle & the backstory. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>&middot;</strong> If you try to skip process, you will never experience events. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>&middot;</strong>  Process is the road trip or wealth. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>&middot;</strong>  Four constituent ingredients that make up the winning formula: 
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  1. Your roadmap
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent">
  - the guiding force behind your actions
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent">
  - Makes up your financial belief system & your preconceived convictions about wealth & money
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  - 3 constituent roadmaps that will chart your course to wealth. 1. The sidewalk. 2. The slow lane. 3. The fast lane
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  2. Your vehicle 
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  - Your vehicle is you
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  - No one can drive the journey but you
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  3. Your roads
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  - Your roads are the financial pathway you travel
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  4. Your speed
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  - Speed is execution & your ability to go from idea to implementation
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  - Without speed your roadmap has no direction, your vehicle stands idle & your road mutates into a dead end. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>&middot;</strong>  Successful fast lane travelers are warriors who live & die on rough roads.  
</p>
<p>
  <strong>&middot;</strong> If you resist the toll, wealth will resist you  
</p>
<p>
  <strong>&middot;</strong> <strong>Expect a price to be paid. Especially risk & sacrifice.</strong>  Expect bumps in the road. When you hit the first pothole know that you are forging the process of your unfolding story.  
</p>
<p>
  <strong>&middot;</strong>  The fast lane process demands sacrifices that few make, to resolve to live few can. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>&middot;</strong>  When someone grants you your desires without you exerting any effort, you effectively handicap the process.  
</p>
<p>
  <strong>&middot;</strong>  The journey is yours. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>&middot;</strong>  Wealth is a formula, not an ingredient. 
</p>
<p>
  <strong>&middot;</strong>  Process makes millionaires. Events are by-products of process.  
</p>
<p>
  <strong>&middot;</strong>  To seek a “wealth chauffeur” is to seek a surrogate for process. Process cannot be outsourced, because process dawns wisdom, personal growth, strength, and events.

    Chapter 4: The Roadmaps to Wealth:
    <span class="icon"></span>
  </summary>
  <div class="list">
    <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
    <strong> Your life unfolds is determined by your choices,</strong> and these choices originate from your belief systems, and those belief systems evolve from your predisposed roadmap.
      </p>
      <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
    <strong>  You want to change you life, change your choices.</strong>
  </p>
  <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
    Each roadmap is naturally predisposed toward a specific destination. Those predispositions are:
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent">
    &middot; The sidewalk ——> Poorness.
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent">
    &middot;  The slow lane ——> Mediocrity.
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent">
    &middot;  The fast lane ——> Wealth.
  </p>
  <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
    Each roadmap contains key mindsets that act as signposts, or “mindposts,” that provide direction and guide actions, just like a roadmap. Those mindposts are:
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent"> 
    &middot; Debt Perception: Does debt control you or do you control your debt?
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent">
    &middot; Time Perception: How is your time valued and treated? Abundant? Fleeting? Inconsequential?
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent">
    &middot; Education Perception: What role does education have in your life?
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent">
    &middot; Money Perception: What is money’s role in your life? Is money a tool or a toy? Plentiful or scarce?
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent">
    &middot; Primary Income Source: What is your primary means of creating income?
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent">
    &middot; Primary Wealth Accelerator: How are you accelerating your net worth and creating wealth? Or are you?
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent">
    &middot; Wealth Perception: How do you define wealth?
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent">
    &middot; Wealth Equation: What is your mathematical plan for accumulating wealth? What wealth equation defines the physics of your wealth universe?
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent">
    &middot; Destination: Is there a destination? If so, what does it look like?
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent">
    &middot; Responsibility & Control: Are you in control of your life and your financial plan?
  </p>
  <p class="p-indent">
    &middot; Life Perception: How do you live your life? Do you plan for the future? Forsake today for tomorrow? Or tomorrow for today?
  </p>
  <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
    To force change, change must come from your beliefs, and your roadmap outlines those beliefs.
  </p>
  <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
    Each roadmap is governed by a wealth equation and predisposed to a financial destination—Sidewalk to poorness, Slowlane to mediocrity, and the Fastlane to wealth.

    Chapter 5: The Road most Travelled: The Sidewalk:
    <span class="icon"></span>
  </summary>
  <div class="list">
    <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
    The Sidewalk is the plan most followed, a contract for a pleasurable today in lieu of a more secure tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
A Sidewalker’s financial destination doesn’t exist. 
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The plan is to have no plan.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Side-walkers are carelessly trapped in a “Lifestyle Servitude” fed by an urgent, insatiable need for pleasure, image & instant gratification.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The Sidewalk is the road most traveled because it’s the path of least resistance.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Side walking symptoms:
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
&middot; You haven’t learned much since graduating from high school or college.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; You change jobs frequently.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; You think people with money have it because they had rich parents, luck, or easier life circumstances than you.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; You are easily impressed and seek to impress.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; You have poor credit.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; You put faith into politicians and government to change the system, instead of focusing on how you can change yourself.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; You view pawnshops, payday loan stores, and credit cards as a means of supplemental income.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; You have filed for bankruptcy at least once.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; You live paycheck to pay-check.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; You don’t alert a business when they give you incorrect change in your favour.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; You have a negative net worth and little, if no savings.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; You have no car insurance, no health insurance, and you have unprotected sex with uncommitted partners.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; You regularly gamble at the casino or buy lottery tickets.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; You immerse yourself in alternate realities, including Web site celebrity gossip blogs, television, sports, video games, or soap operas.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; You’ve lost money on “get rich” schemes.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; Your family cringes when you ask for money or you quit asking because you know a lecture follows.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Sidewalk is about the short term, it never works for the long term. 
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Your future becomes a mortgage for a pleasant present.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The first step to escape the Sidewalk is recognizing that you might be on it . . . then replace it with something that works.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
You can’t medicate poor money management with more money.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Financial discipline is blind to income. Lack of financial discipline resides on the Sidewalk and it doesn’t care what you earn or what you drive.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
More money is not a solution to poor financial management.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Those lacking financial discipline misuse money to delay the inevitable.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Only a mindset change regarding money is a solution to money problems.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Get off the Sidewalk and stop equating wealth to income and debt.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
A first-class ticket to the Sidewalk is to have no financial plan.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The Sidewalk’s natural gravitational pull is poorness, both in time and money.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
You cannot solve poor financial management with more money.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
You can be income rich and still ride the Sidewalk dirty.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
If wealth is defined by income and debt, wealth is an illusion, because it is vulnerable to potholes, detours, and “bumps in the road.” When the income disappears, so does the illusion of wealth.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Poor financial management is like gambling; the house eventually wins.

    Chapter 6: Has your Wealth been Toxified:
    <span class="icon"></span>
  </summary>
  <div class="list">
    <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
      Wealth is not authored by material possessions, money, or “stuff,” but by what I call the three fundamental “F’s”…
      </p>
      <p class="p-indent">
      &middot; Family(relationships)
    </p>
    <p class="p-indent">
    &middot; Fitness (health)
    </p>
    <p class="p-indent">
    &middot; Freedom(choice)
  </p>
  <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
      Within this wealth trinity is where you will find true wealth and, yes, happiness.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
      Wealth is strong-spirited familial relationships with people. Not just your family, but with people, your community, your God, and your friends.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
      Wealth is making a difference. Wealth is community and impacting the lives of others. Wealth cannot be experienced alone in a vacuum.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
      Wealth is fitness: health, vibrancy, passion, and boundless energy. If you don’t have health, you lack wealth.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
      There is no price on health and vibrancy.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
      Wealth is freedom and choice: freedom to live how you want to live, what, when, and where.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
      Freedom to passionately pursue dreams.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
      And freedom from the drudgery of doing things you hate. Freedom is the liberty to live your life as you please.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
      Wealth isn’t embodied in a car but in the freedom to know that you can buy it.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
      Priorities: Some want to look rich, while others want to be rich.
    </p>
    <p> <strong>&middot;</strong>
      Like a Chinese finger-cuff, the more you try to look rich, the tighter the grip of poorness becomes.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      The irony of looking wealthy is that it is an enemy to real wealth: It destroys freedom, it destroys health, and it destroys relationships.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Freedom offers protection to health and relationships. Only you can define your freedom and how you prefer to live.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Wealth is authored by strong familial relationships, fitness and health, and freedom—not by material possessions. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Unaffordable material possessions are destructive to the wealth trinity.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Faux wealth destroys real wealth by attacking it’s sibling components: health & relationships.

    Chapter 7: Misuse Money & Money will Misuse you:
    <span class="icon"></span>
  </summary>
  <div class="list">
    <p>
      <strong>&middot;</strong>
      Money can’t buy happiness, but it can make you awfully comfortable while you’re being miserable. ~ Clare Boothe Luce
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      People who declare, “Money doesn’t buy happiness” have already concluded they will never have money.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      The irony is that when most people earn “more money,” it doesn’t add freedom, it detracts. By creating Lifestyle Servitude, more money becomes destructive to the wealth trinity: family, fitness, and freedom.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      The fact is, there are many millionaires and well paid career folks who are absolutely miserable, and it has nothing to do with the money. It has to do with their freedom. Money owns them, instead of them owning their money.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      You’re conditioned to accept normal based on society’s already corrupted definition of wealth, and because of it, normal itself is corrupted. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Normal is modern-day slavery.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      We have become a nation of undisciplined spenders and consumers.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      If you’re held hostage to your lifestyle, you aren’t wealthy, because you lack freedom.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      We equate the corrupted definition of wealth with happiness, and when it doesn’t deliver, expectations are violated and unhappiness is the consequence.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Used properly, money buys freedom, and freedom is one parcel in the wealth trinity. Freedom buys choices.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Money secures one agent of the wealth formula, freedom, which is a powerful guardian to wealth’s sibling ingredients: health and relationships.
    </p>
    <p class="p-indent">
      &middot Money buys the freedom to watch your kids grow up.
    </p>
    <p class="p-indent">
      &middot Money buys the freedom to pursue your craziest dreams.
    </p>
    <p class="p-indent">
      &middot; Money buys the freedom to make a difference in the world.
    </p>
  <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
    We’re taught to strive for the latest and greatest regardless of consequence. It leaves us indentured for years, condemning us to lifestyle imprisonment…
  </p>
  <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Affordability is when you don’t have to think about it. 
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
If you have to think about “affordability,” you can’t afford it because affordability carries conditions and consequences.

<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
So how do you know if you can afford it? If you pay cash and your lifestyle doesn’t change regardless of future circumstances, you can afford it.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
To overcome wealth impersonation, know what you can and can’t afford.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Money doesn’t buy happiness because money is used for consumer pursuits destructive to freedom. Anything destructive to freedom is destructive to the wealth trinity. 
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Money, properly used, can buy freedom, which can lead to happiness.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Happiness stems from good health, freedom, and strong interpersonal relationships, not necessarily money.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Lifestyle Servitude steals freedom, and what steals freedom, steals wealth.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
If you think you can afford it, you can’t.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The consequence of instant gratification is the destruction of freedom, health, and choice.

    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
    	I’m not lucky; I’m a player of the game.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Process creates events that others see as luck.
 </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Understand that luck is a product of process, action, work, and being “out there.” & when you are “out there” you stand a chance at being in the right place at the right time.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Like wealth, luck is not an event but an aftereffect of process. Luck is the residue of process.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Side walker’s love events but hate process.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Force your process out into the world and you can defy the odds of “being in the right place at the right time.”
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
When life is played to win, luck shows its face.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
A Sidewalker’s mindset is anchored in three beliefs that keep them trapped there and vulnerable to moneymaking scams:
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; Belief 1: Luck is needed for wealth.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; Belief 2: Wealth is an event.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; Belief 3: Others can give wealth to me.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Wealth is not about luck but about process improving probabilities
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Only you can deliver yourself to true wealth
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Like wealth, luck is created by process, not by event.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Luck is created by increased probabilities that are improved with the process of action.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
If you find yourself playing the odds of “big hits,” you are event-driven, not process-driven. This mindset is conducive to the Sidewalk, not the Fastlane.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
“Get Rich Quick” infomercial marketing is a Fastlane because savvy marketers know that Sidewalkers place faith in events over process.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Moneymaking “systems” are rarely as profitable as the act of selling them to Sidewalkers.

    	Responsibility is the price of greatness.
~ Winston Churchill
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Side walker’s manifesto: faith unto others, and when things don’t work out as intended, blame unto others
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The Law of Victims says you can’t be a victim if you don’t relinquish power to someone capable of making you a victim.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The road to victimhood is through denial: First responsibility, then accountability
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
People who don’t take responsibility are victims.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Victims are Sidewalkers who refuse to take the driver’s seat of their own lives & live under a dark cloud of “theys” reflective of a “me against them” attitude
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The Fastlane is about control.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Accountability is being culpable to your consequences & modifying your behavior if need be to prevent those consequences.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Own that you made a mistake & learn from it. That’s what true accountability & responsibility is all about.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; Own your mistakes, failures, and triumphs.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; Reflect on your choices.
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; Are you in a situation because you delivered yourself there?
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; Did you error in the process?
</p>
<p class="p-indent">
  &middot; Were you lazy?
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Most bad situations are consequences of bad choices
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Own them and you own your life
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
No one can steer you off course, because you are in the driver’s seat.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
When you own your decisions, something miraculous happen. Failure doesn’t become the badge of victimhood—it becomes wisdom.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
You deserve what your actions earned, or haven’t earned.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
When you’re accountable to your choices, you alter your behavior in the future and take the driver’s seat of your life
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Hitchhikers assign control over their financial plans to others effectively introducing probabilities to victimhood.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The Law of Victims: You can’t be a victim if you don’t relinquish power to someone capable of making you a victim.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Responsibility owns your choices.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Taking responsibility is the first step to taking the driver’s seat of your life. Accountability is the final.

    	The driving force behind wealth under Get Rich Slow is time—time employed at the job and time invested in the markets.
      </p>
      <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
You can either live rich young or live rich old while risking death along the way.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The plan is a failure because the plan is based on time and factors you can’t control.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The Slowlane is risky and insufferably impotent.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Time is mismanaged because the Slowlane is predicated on time
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The Slowlane is a natural course-correction from the Sidewalk evolving from taking responsibility and accountability.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
Wealth is best experienced when you’re young, vibrant, and able, not in the twilight of your life.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The Slowlane is a plan that takes decades to succeed, often requiring masterful political prowess in a corporate environment. For the Slowlaner, Saturday and Sunday is the paycheck for Monday through Friday.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The default return on your time in the Slowlane is negative 60%—5-for- 2.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>
The 5-for-2 trade inherit in the Slowlane is generally fixed and cannot be manipulated, because job standards are five days a week.
</p>

      Jobs suck because they’re rooted in limited leverage and limited control.
    </p>

      Why not get paid with the simple passage of time and make time work for you instead of against you?
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
      The problem with a specialized skill set is, it narrows your useful value to a confined set of marketplace needs. You become one of many cogs in a wheel.

    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
      A job limits learning and mutates into life’s death knell: a trade of life force for money.

  </summary>
  <div class="list">
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
      To accumulate financial wealth, you need to attract large sums of money. To attract large sums of money, you need two things: 1) Control and 2) Leverage
      </p>
      <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Intrinsic value is what you earn working a job.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Intrinsic value is measured in units of time, either hourly or annually
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Time has no leverage.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Your time is limited to small numbers and cannot be leveraged.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      leverage is limited, so is wealth creation. Small numbers do not make millionaires.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      To trade your time away is to trade your wealth away
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      You don’t want millions to accompany your cane, you want it to accompany your youth.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Any financial plan without control immediately disintegrates into a plan of hope.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Hop isn’t a plan 
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Slowlane wealth is improbable due to Uncontrollable Limited Leverage (ULL).
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      The first variable in the Slowlane wealth equation evolves from a job that factors to intrinsic value that equates to your nominal value for each unit of your life traded.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Intrinsic value is the value of your time set by the marketplace and is measured in units of time, either hourly or yearly.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      In the Slowlane, intrinsic value (regardless of its time measurement) is numerically inhibited because there are only 24 hours in the day (for the hourly worker),and the average lifespan is 74 years (for the salaried worker).
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Like the Slowlaner’s primary income source (a job), the Slowlaner’s wealth acceleration vehicle (compound interest) is also pegged to time. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Like a job, compound interest is mathematically futile and cannot be manipulated. You cannot force-feed the market (or the economy) to give you phenomenal returns, year after year.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Wealth cannot be accelerated when pegged to mathematics.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Time is your primordial fuel and it should not be traded for money. Your time should not be an expendable resource for wealth because wealth itself is composed of time.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      Your mortality makes time mathematically retarded for wealth creation. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>
      If you don’t control the variables inherent in your wealth universe, you don’t control your financial plan.

      <p><strong>&middot;</strong> 
      When you succeed as a producer, you can consume anything you want.

      Fastlaners are producers, entrepreneurs, innovators, visionaries, and creators.
      <p><strong>&middot;</strong> 
      A business does not make a Fastlane—some businesses are jobs in disguise.
      <p><strong>&middot;</strong> 
      The Fastlane wealth equation is not bound by time and its variables are unlimited and controllable.

      High speed limit = high potential income
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
      The key to the Fastlane wealth equation is to have a high speed limit, or an unlimited range of values for units sold. This creates leverage. The market for your product or service determines your upper limit.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
      The higher your speed limit, the higher your income potential.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
      The primary wealth accelerant for the rich is asset value, defined as appreciable assets created, founded, or bought. 
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Wealth creation via asset value is accelerated by each industry’s average multiplier. For every dollar in net income realized, the asset value multiplies by a factor of the multiple.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Your industry of specialization will determine the average multiple that determines your wealth accelerant factor. If the multiple is 3, your WAF is 300%.
    </p>
    <p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Liquidation events transform appreciated assets (“paper” net worth) into money (“real” net worth) that can be transformed into another passive income stream: a money system.

<p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
Savvy Fastlane entrepreneurs recognize that a successful local business with weak leverage can be made highly leveraged by franchises or chains
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
To divorce yourself from the Slowlane’s transactional relationship of “time for money,” you need to become a producer, specifically, a business owner.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
Business systems break the bond between “your time for money” because they act like surrogate operatives for your time trade.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
If you have a passive income that exceeds all your needs and lifestyle expenses including taxes, you’re retired.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
Retirement can happen at any age.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
The fruit from a money tree is passive income.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
A Fastlane objective is to create a business system that survives time, exclusive of your time.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
The 5 money-tree seedlings are rental systems, computer systems, content systems, distribution systems, and human-resource systems.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
Real estate, licenses, and patents are examples of rental systems.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
Internet and software businesses are examples of computer systems.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
Authoring books, blogging, and magazines are forms of content systems.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
Franchising, chaining, network marketing, and television marketing are examples of distribution systems.
</p>
<p><strong>&middot;</strong>  
Human resource systems can add or subtract to passivity.

Human resource systems are the most expensive to manage and implement.

    Chapter 32: The commandment of Control:
    <span class="icon"></span>
  </summary>
  <div class="list">
    <p>
    	<strong>&middot;</strong>  
      If you don’t control your system, your money tree, and your brand, you control nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Hitchhikers relinquish control of their business to a Fastlaner.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      There is a difference between “good” money and “big” money. Hitchhikers can make good money while Fastlaners make big money. Sometimes legendary money.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      In a driver/hitchhiker relationship, the driver always retains control and the hitchhiker is at the mercy of the driver.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Hitchhikers are party to someone else’s Fastlane plan. Make the world your habitat of play in an organization you control.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Network marketing has little to do with entrepreneurship but more to do with sales, networking, training, and motivation.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Network marketing fails both the Commandments of Control and Entry, and sometimes, Need.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Network marketers are soldiers in a Fastlaner’s army.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Network marketing is a powerful distribution system. As a Fastlaner, seek to own one, not join one.

    Chapter 33: The commandment of Scale:
    <span class="icon"></span>
  </summary>
  <div class="list">
    <p>
    	<strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Your total pool of customers determines your habitat. The larger the habitat, the greater the potential for wealth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      A business can be a singles or a home-run-based business. Its strength is determined by scale, which is derived by habitat.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      The Fastlane wealth equation is disarmed when you violate the Commandment of Scale. Scale is achieved in reach (units sold) and/or magnitude (unit profit).
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      The Law of Effection is the primary conduit to wealth, which can be road blocked by scale, magnitude, or source.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Effection consequences trickle up to owners and producers. Breaking scale or magnitude indirectly in an uncontrolled entity is not a guarantee of wealth.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      To gain access to Effection, you have to break the barrier of scale or magnitude in an entity you control.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Scale, magnitude, or source deficiencies create governors on the speed of wealth creation.

      A business attached to your time is a job.

      The business that earns income exclusive of your time satisfies the Commandment of Time.

      The best Fastlanes satisfy all five Commandments: Control, Entry, Need, Time, and Scale.
      </p>

        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Assuming a need-based premise, the Internet is the fastest interstate, because it overwhelmingly satisfies all Commandments.

      Innovation can be any variety of open roads: authoring, inventing, or services.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Inventing success needs coupling with distribution.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      A singles-based business is scaled to a home-run business by intentional iteration. With iteration, scale is conquered.

      Opportunities are rarely about inventing breakthroughs, but about performance gaps, small inconveniences, and pain points.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Competition should not impede your road. Competition is everywhere, and your objective should be to “do it better.”
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Fastlane success resides in execution, not in the idea.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      The world’s most successful entrepreneurs didn’t have a blockbuster ideas; they just took existing concepts and made them better, or exposed them to more people.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Opportunity is exposed in your language and your thought processes, as well as other people’s language.

      The tragedy of life doesn’t lie in not reaching your goal. The tragedy lies in having no goal to reach.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      The Fastlane is the means to your end because dreams cost money.

      Conquer big goals by breaking them down to their smallest component.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Daily saving reinforces your relationship with money; it is your passive system that buys freedom and another soldier added to your army.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      A money system isn’t used to grow wealth but to grow income. Growing wealth should be left to your Fastlane road.

        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      You will struggle to build a financial empire if you are financially illiterate.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      “Live below your means” is relevant at any income level.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      For the Fastlaner, “Live below your means” means to expand your means.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      A financial adviser doesn’t solve financial illiteracy and literacy is insurance.
      <p>

      Financial illiteracy dilutes your control, especially when evaluating the advice of a financial adviser.

      Successful Fastlane businesses are run multi-dimensionally, like a game of chess. One-dimensional businesses focus on price only.

        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Execution divides winners and losers from their ideas.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      In business, execution is process. Ideas are events.
      <p>

      Ideas are potential speed. Execution is actual speed.
      <p>
        <strong>&middot;</strong>  
      Others share your blockbuster idea. He who thinks the idea owns nothing. He who executes the idea owns everything.
      <p>

      Real money and momentum is created when an idea (potential speed) is matched with execution (accelerator pressure).

      Business plans are useless because they are ideas on steroids.

      As soon as the world interacts with your ideas, your business plan is invalidated.

      The marketplace will steer you into directions that were previously unplanned for.

      Poor service gaps are Fastlane opportunities.
